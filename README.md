## Second homework

The task was to create a project that demonstrates interaction between entities. I have chosen to do the website on which you can search the lyrics of the music you need.

I have been using the JetBrains Webstorm IDE, so to start the project you need to launch it on a server by Webstorm. To do this you need to open the index.html file and click the icon (in the upper right corner) of the browser you use (personally I used Chrome).

Enjoy!
