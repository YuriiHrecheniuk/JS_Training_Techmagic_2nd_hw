## Second homework

The task was to create a project that demonstrates interaction between entities. I have chosen to do the website on which you can search the lyrics of the music you need. To do this I used lyrics.ovh API.

To use it just enter the artist and title of a song, and you get its lyrics (e.g. artist: Lil Peep, title: Star Shopping).

Also you can get random Kanye West quote by pressing the corresponding button. To do this functionality I used kanye.rest API.

I have been using the JetBrains WebStorm IDE, so to start the project you need to launch it on a server by WebStorm. To do this you need to open the index.html file in WebStorm and click the icon (in the upper right corner) of the browser you use (personally I used Chrome).

Enjoy!
